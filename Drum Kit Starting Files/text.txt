constructor fxns have the first letter capitalised as convention.
it contains the object along with its attributes.
example:
function Ballboy (name,age,languages){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.languages = languages //array
    this.clean = function () {
        alert("cleaning in progress...");
        alert("cleaning done!");
    }
    //function inside the constructor Ballboy
    //to call it just type {Ballboy object}.clean()
}
